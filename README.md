A copy of J. David's webserver, written in C, modify for Linux.

I modify it, then add the python version, **httpd.py** for study porpuse.


by the way, it also shiped some other file:

* threadexample.c (a simple thread example)
* thread.py (comparable version in python)
* rpccli.py rpcsvr.py (python simple rpc tools for debug)
